## üß© Awesome features

OpenIM-SDK-core is a core SDK of OpenIM. 

1. Manage WebSocket long connections, responsible for creating, closing and reconnecting connections. 
2. Encoding and decoding. Encode and decode messages in binary format to achieve cross-language compatibility.
3. Implement basic protocols of OpenIM, such as login, push, etc. 
4. Provide an event handling mechanism to convert received messages into corresponding events and pass them to upper layer applications for processing.
5. Cache management. Manage user, group, blacklists, and other cache information. 
6. Provide basic IM function APIs such as sending messages, creating groups, etc. Hide the underlying implementation details from the upper layer application.
